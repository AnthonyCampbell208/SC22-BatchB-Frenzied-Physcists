{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"57ce45","input":"**Box and Whisker Plot Class/Age Satisfaction:** \n\nBackground: Eco, Eco Plus, and Business are different classes going from cheapest to most expensive.

In the Business class you get the same as Eco Plus but with comfier seats with fluffy pillows, televised entertainment, superior drinks and meals, and much more.\n\nAnalysis: From the graph, we can determine that people are less satisfied in the Eco and Eco Plus class and more satisfied in the Business Class because the dissatisfied boxes for Eco and Eco Plus are higher than their satisfied boxes. In contrast, the satisfied box for Business is higher than its dissatisfied box. This would make sense since the Business class has more perks and raises satisfaction levels for people.

There is a general trend that when flight distance increases, the number of people flying business class increases, and the opposite is true for economy class.

Because arrival delay doesn't really impact passenger loyalty realistically, we cannot draw the conclusion that loyal passengers experience longer delays.
