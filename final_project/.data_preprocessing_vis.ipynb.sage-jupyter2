{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4fe900","input":"Background: These pie charts show the relationship between passenger satisfaction and the passenger's scores for the on\\-board service they received during the flight. The upper chart shows the scores for satisfied passengers, and the lower chart shows the scores for unsatisfied passengers. Each score is color coded: dark blue for 5, blue for 4, light blue for 3, light red for 2, red for 1, and dark red for 0.\n\nAnalysis: There were almost no 0 scores given, meaning that most of the airline service was not detrimental. It's clear that there were more 4s and 5s given by satisfied passengers compared to unsatisfied passengers, around 70% compared to around 40%. Overall, the amount of blue \\(neutral to good\\) scores given by passengers was greater from satisfied passengers as well. In general, lower scores were given by unsatisfied passengers. 3 was the most popular score from unsatisfied passengers, compared to 4 by satisfied passengers. Thus, it can be observed that \nflight satisfaction is at least correlated to on\\-board service.\n\n","pos":61,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"504ad0","input":"Background: This overlay histogram shows the relationship between age group and satisfaction levels with flights. The y\\-axis measures the number of people in each age group that were satisfied or unsatisfied by their experience. The red coloration represents satisfaction while the blue coloration represents unsatisfied passengers.\n\nAnalysis: The graph of unsatisfied passengers is skewed right, and the graph of satisfied passengers is skewed left. This means that in general, older people are more satisfied with their flights than younger people. There were around 500\\-700 more unsatisfied passengers in the age groups from 0 to 39, but around 400\\-600 more satisfied passengers from the age groups 39 to 60. Interestingly enough, people over the age of 60 begin to become more unsatisfied with their flights again. This is probably because younger people have more complaints and requirements for comfort than older passengers, but once passengers get old enough where flying is an inconvenience, they begin to be more unsatisfied with their experiences again.\n\n","pos":48,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"57ce45","input":"**Box and Whisker Plot Class/Age Satisfaction:** \n\nBackground: Eco, Eco Plus, and Business are different classes going from cheapest to most expensive. The Eco class is the basic class on an airplane. The Eco Plus has more perks; for example priority boarding, more leg room, better drinks and food, and more, but not as many as the Business class. In the Business class you get the same as Eco Plus but with comfier seats with fluffy pillows, televised entertainment, superior drinks and meals, and much more.\n\nAnalysis: From the graph we can determine that people are less satisfied in the Eco and Eco Plus and more satisfied in the Business Class because the dissatisfied boxes for Eco and Eco Plus are higher than the satisfied boxes while the satisfied box for Business is higher than the dissatisfied box. Business class has slightly older people enjoying their flight compared to younger people since the satisfied business box is shifted up from the dissatisfied business box. It also seems like it doesn't really matter which class you're in since they're all in the same range except for the Business class.\n\n","pos":14,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6bf5ae","input":"Background: These pie charts show the number and percentage of passengers that fly on short, medium, and long\\-distance flights and what classes they fly those flights on. Short\\-distance flights have a length of 700 miles or lower, medium\\-distance flights have lengths between 700 and 3000 miles, and long\\-distance flights have lengths over 3000 miles. The classes are represented by different colors, blue for economy, green for economy\\-plus, and red for business.\n\nAnalysis: For short\\-distance flights, close to 60% of passengers flew economy class, while only around 30% flew business class. In medium\\-distance flights, around 55% of passengers flew business class while only 40% flew economy class. In long\\-distance flights, nearly all of the passengers flew business class. There is a general trend that when flight distance increases, the number of people flying business class increases, and the opposite is true for economy class. Economy\\-plus class doesn't seem to be a popular choice for most people, and it follows the pattern of flight distance to passenger amount that economy class does, just on a smaller scale. This suggests that most long\\-distance flights are flown in business class.\n\n","pos":65,"type":"cell"}

The variables include Age, Flight distance, Departure Delay in Minutes, and Arrival Delay in Minutes. From the matrix, we see that with most variable combinations there is no correlation. We see this because for most of the scatterplots there is no upward or downward trend meaning there is no positive or negative correlation. The one exception with this is Departure Delay in minutes vs Arrival Delay in Minutes. From this scatterplot we see an upward trending scatterplot that is tightly bound.

In business class, satisfied passengers have flown around twice as much compared to unsatisfied passengers.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9ddff7","input":"Background: This scatter plot shows the flight distance and arrival delay for each flight that the passengers took. It shows in color and size if the customer was loyal or not \\(assuming to be if there are in a FFP or not\\): red small dots are disloyal passengers, and large blue dots are loyal passengers.\n\nAnalysis: Based on the visualization, it seems that loyal passengers are more likely to fly for longer distances, as there are a group of blue dots in the 3000\\-4000 flight distance section, but very few red dots. Because arrival delay doesn't really impact passenger loyalty realistically, we cannot draw the conclusion that loyal passengers experience longer delays. However, it is evident that disloyal passengers tend to fly shorter distances than loyal passengers. This suggests that because disloyal passengers do not get much benefit of frequently flying long\\-distance, they do not fly long\\-distance very often.\n\n","pos":63,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed6934","input":"**Box and Whisker Plot Flight Distance/Type of Travel Satisfaction:**\n\nSince the box and whisker for satisfied business travel is longer than the dissatisfied business travel, people are more satisfied with greater flight distance; however, for personal travel, flight distance has no affect on satisfaction since both plots are very similar.  A reason for the business travel satisfaction may be because people don't have to pay for their trip, their flight is more memorable since it's for work, they may have gotten what they wanted and are very happy, getting new experiences from traveling, or other reasons. The satisfaction reason for personal travel may be due to people paying for their flight, traveling with family instead of being alone, they had to go for a cheaper airline, or other reasons. These reasons also may not matter to a person for their personal trip so they were satisfied. \nIn conclusion, people who go on business trips are more likely to enjoy their flight than those who go on personal trips and there are several probable reasons for this.\n\n","pos":19,"type":"cell"}
